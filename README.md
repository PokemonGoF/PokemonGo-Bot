### Google Maps API (Code is not done yet)


Google Maps API: a brief guide to your own key

This project uses Google Maps. There's one map coupled with the project, but as it gets more popular we'll definitely hit the rate-limit making the map unusable. That said, here's how you can get your own and replace ours:

1. Navigate to this [page](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend,geocoding_backend,directions_backend,distance_matrix_backend,elevation_backend,places_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE&reusekey=true)
2. Select 'Create a project' in the dropdown menu.
3. Wait an eternity.
4. Click 'Create' on the next page (optionally, fill out the info)
5. Copy the API key that appears.
6. After the code done, will update here how to replace.

## Usage
    usage: pokecli.py [-h] -a AUTH_SERVICE -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -l LOCATION [-w] [-d] [-t] [-c] [-m]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help                                    show this help message and exit
      -a AUTH_SERVICE, --auth_service AUTH_SERVICE  Auth Service ('ptc' or 'google')
      -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME              Username
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD              Password
      -l LOCATION, --location LOCATION              Location (Address or 'xx.yyyy,zz.ttttt')
      -w SPEED,  --walk SPEED                       Walk instead of teleport with given speed (meters per second max 4.16 because of walking end on 15km/h)
      -m MODE, --mode MODE                              Set farming Mode for the bot ('all', 'poke', 'farm')
      --maxstep MAX_STEP                            Set the steps around your initial location(DEFAULT 5 mean 25 cells around your location)
      -c CP, --cp                                   Set the CP to transfer or lower (eg. 100 will transfer CP0-99)
      -d, --debug                                   Debug Mode
      -t, --test                                    Only parse the specified location


### Command Line Example
    Pokemon Trainer Club (PTC) account:
    $ python2 pokecli.py -a ptc -u tejado -p 1234 --location "New York, Washington Square"
    Google Account:

## FAQ

### Losing Starter Pokemon and others
    You can use -c 1 to protect your first stage low CP pokemon.
### Does it run automatally?
    Not yet, still need a trainer to train the script param. But we are very close to.
### Set GEO Location
    It works, use -l "xx.yyyy,zz.ttttt" to set lat long for location. -- diordache
### FLEE
   The status code "3" corresponds to "Flee" - meaning your Pokemon has ran away.
   {"responses": { "CATCH_POKEMON": { "status": 3 } }
### My pokemon are not showing up in my Pokedex?
   Finish the tutorial on a smartphone. This will then allow everything to be visible.
### How can I maximise my XP per hour?
Quick Tip: When using this script, use a Lucky egg to double the XP for 30 mins. You will level up much faster. A Lucky egg is obtained on level 9 and further on whilst leveling up. (from VipsForever via /r/pokemongodev)
