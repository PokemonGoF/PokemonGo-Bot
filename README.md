## Gym Battles
This bot takes a strong stance against automating gym battles. Botting gyms will have a negative effect on most players and thus the game as a whole. We will thus never accept contributions or changes containing code specific for gym battles.

## Analytics
This bot is very popular and has a vibrant community. Because of that, it has become very difficult for us to know how the bot is used and what errors people hit. By capturing small amounts of data, we can prioritize our work better such as fixing errors that happen to a large percentage of our user base, not just a vocal minority.

Our goal is to help inform our decisions by capturing data that helps us get aggregate usage and error reports, not personal information. To view the code that handles analytics in our master branch, you can use this [search link](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=BotEvent).

If there are any concerns with this policy or you believe we are tracking something we shouldn't, please open a ticket in the tracker. The contributors always intend to do the right thing for our users, and we want to make sure we are held to that path.

If you do not want any data to be gathered, you can turn off this feature by setting `health_record` to `false` in your `config.json`.
