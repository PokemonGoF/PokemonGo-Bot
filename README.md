# PokemonGo-Bot
[PokemonGo-Bot](https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot) is a project created by the [PokemonGoF](https://github.com/PokemonGoF) team. Since no public API available for now, a patch to use HASH-Server was applied. PokemonGoF is not part of HASH-Server dev team and has no connection with it.
