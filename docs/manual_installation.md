### Linux and Mac
Ubuntu will be used for the Linux Example

####First install required packages

#####Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config make python2.7-dev wget git
```
####
if you are on a different Linux OS you maybe have to adapt things like:

- package mananger (for example yum instead of apt-get)
- package names

#####Mac
```bash
brew install --devel protobuf
brew install  autoconf libtool pkg-config wget git
```
####Mac + Linux installation
make shure you installed everything above

- get pip for pyton2.7
```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python2.7 get-pip.py
rm -f get-pip.py
```

- switch to the location where you want to install it
- get git Repository and switch into the downloaded Folder

(Please keep in mind that master is not always up-to-date whereas 'dev' is. In the installation note below change `master` to `dev` if you want to get and use the latest version.)
```bash
git clone --recursive -b master https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot  
cd PokemonGo-Bot
```
####
- install virtualenv and activate it
```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .
```
####
- install the requirements and get the needen encryption.so

(we move `encrypt.so` to the root folder of the Bot so no need to edit the config regarding that)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
wget http://pgoapi.com/pgoencrypt.tar.gz
tar -xzvf pgoencrypt.tar.gz
cd pgoencrypt/src/
make
cd ../../
mv pgoencrypt/src/libencrypt.so encrypt.so
```
####
- copy and edit the config
(after copying it you can use any editor you like if you don't like `vi`) 
```bash
cp configs/config.json.example configs/config.json
vi configs/config.json
```
####
- make shure your git repo is up to date
(make shure you are in the bot folder and activated virtualenv)
```bash
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
####
- finaly start the bot
```bash
./run.sh configs/config.json
```
####
- after reboot or closing the terminal at every new start go into the folder of the PokemonGo-Bot by going into the folder where you startet installing it an then
```bash
cd PokemonGo-Bot
#activate virtualenv and start
source bin/activate
./run.sh configs/config.json
```
