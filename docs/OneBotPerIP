Run multiple bots on the same server (linux)

To run multiple bots on a single server that has multiple ips assigned Im preloading a library that allows me to direct
bot traffic on the ip that interests me

I have relied on the document https://www.x4b.net/kb/BindProcessToIPonLinux for installing the library on my VPS


apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install g ++ - multilib libc6-dev-i386
wget -O https://www.x4b.net/files/bind.c.txt bind.c
cp /usr/lib/bind.so bind.o

To run the bot would have to run

BIND_ADDR=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/bind.so /usr/bin/python  pokecli.py

where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the ip that I want to assign to the bot
