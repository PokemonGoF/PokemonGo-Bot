How to configure the multibot scripts

first you need to install screen.
how to depends on your package manager (assuming you are running linux).

then change the parameters in EACH file to suit your preferences
the names you choose MUST be coherent between file
(i.e. confiName1 in start_pokego must be the same as configName1 in status/restart/stop_pokego)

- screenName is the name of the screen that will be created
- configName is the config file for that account (must be placed in configs folder and named configName.config
- username.. well its your username (doesnt need to be tho)

note: you can also leave the parameters like this and just call your config file "configName1",
but its really ugly.
TODO: autoconfig script

to run:
./start_pokego.sh 
#will kill and restart all bots and web server if already running. (killing the screens)

to stop:
./stop_pokego.sh 
#will stop all bot and the web server. (killing the screens)

note: all bots are started in a loop so if they crash they will restart automatically.

if you stop some of them manually and dont remember which one you can check which bot is currently running with:
./status_pokego.sh

you can restart only currently running bots with:
./restart_pokego.sh
#will kill the bot process but neither the loop nor the screen, so the bot will restart.

you can also interact with screen directly using:

screen -r screenName #to attach to a screen
C-a d to detach
screen -list #to check a list of the running screens
(checkout the manual for screen running "man screen" for more info)
